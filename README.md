# CS5110-Final-Project

## Setting up
To run our project, set up a virtual python environment with `python -m venv .venv`, then activate it by typing `source .venv/Scripts/activate` in a UNIX environment. Finally, install the required dependencies into your new virtual environment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running the project
With that, you can run the main file using `python3 src/main.py`.
You will see a window pop up and ... `TODO`

## Breaking down
Finally, deactivate your new environment so it doesn't bother you later by simply typing `deactivate`.
